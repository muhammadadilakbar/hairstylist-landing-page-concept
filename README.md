# hairstylist-landing-page-concept

HTML/CSS implementation of a free Figma design.

See my development of this design here: https://muhammadadilakbar.github.io/hairstylist-landing-page-concept/

See the Figma design here: https://www.figma.com/file/ywXEcEX4uuXvczhNHJ1lKW/Hairstylist-Landing-Page-Concept-(Community)

No CSS framework was used to code this design. Since this was a concept design, so this webpage is not responsive. The frame in Figma was 1440px wide. The implementation looks good on 1200px and wider screens. Best viewed at 1440px wide screens.
